## New stuff for Amok
### General
- Track cages 
- cleanliness of the cage for organic dogs
- cleanliness of the litter box for organic cats
- oil/maintence level for robotic animals

### All clases 
- Encapsulate all instance variables
- assign appropiate visability modifiers to methods used internally by a class or within a class hierarchy

### VirtualPet class and related subclasses/interfaces
- *This is in addition to the VirtualPetShelter requirements*
- create a modle that allows for dogs and cats (either can be robotic or organic)
- introduce an attribute (instance variable) representing overall health that is updated as a result of other attributes moving in a negative or positive direction, influencing happiness
- introduce methods that allow for:
	- oiling robotic pets
	- walking organic dogs (this should decrease the likelihood of soiling their cages, and increase hapiness)
- do not allow:
	- feeding/watering of robotic pets
	- oiling of organic pets
- modify the tick method to return a value indicating the amount of waste a pet creates, which should contribute to either (optionally, create accessor methods to retrieve these values instead):
	- amount of wate in the litter box
	- amount of waste in an individual dog cage

### VirtualPetShelter class
- *This is in addition to the VirtualPetShelter requirements*
- introduce methods that allow for:
	- oiling/maintaining all robotic pets
	- cleaning dog cages
	- emptying the litterbox
- modify existing methods to only feed/water pets that are not robotic

### VirtualPetShelterApp class
- *This is in addition to the VirtualPetShelter requirements*
- add options to:
	- walk all dogs
	- clean dog cages
	- clean the shelter litterbox
	- oil all robotic pets
